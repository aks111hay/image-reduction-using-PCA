# PCA Image Reduction Web App

This is a simple web application built with Flask, designed to perform **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction on uploaded images. The app allows users to upload an image, apply PCA to reduce its complexity, and download the reduced image.

## Features

- **Upload an Image**: Users can upload any image in formats supported by PIL (like JPG, PNG).
- **PCA Image Reduction**: Users can specify a reduction percentage (e.g., 50%) to reduce the complexity of the image using PCA.
- **Download Reduced Image**: Once PCA is applied, the user can download the reduced image.
- **Fun Learning**: A fun way to experiment with PCA and see its effects on images!

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for Python.
- **PIL (Pillow)**: A Python Imaging Library to handle image processing.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **HTML**: For creating the template to upload images and display the interface.

## How to Run the App Locally

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd pca-image-reduction
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    If you don't have a virtual environment set up, you can create one using:
    ```
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
    - On Windows:
      ```
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    You can create a `requirements.txt` file by running:
    ```
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
    Make sure it includes:
    ```
    Flask==<version>
    Pillow==<version>
    numpy==<version>
    ```

5. **Run the Flask App**:
    ```
    python app.py
    ```

    The app will start running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default.

## How to Use the App

1. **Visit the Website**: Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

2. **Upload an Image**: On the homepage, you'll see a form where you can upload an image file.

3. **Select Reduction Percentage**: Enter the percentage by which you want to reduce the image using PCA (e.g., 50%).

4. **Download the Reduced Image**: Once the image is processed, a download link will appear. You can download the reduced image in PNG format.

## How PCA Works

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in data analysis and machine learning. For images, PCA reduces the number of features (pixels) that represent the image while preserving its most important structures (principal components).

- **Step 1**: The image is converted into a numerical array.
- **Step 2**: PCA computes the covariance matrix of the image and calculates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
- **Step 3**: The most significant components (eigenvectors) are retained, while less important components are discarded.
- **Step 4**: The image is reconstructed using these reduced components.

The result is an image with fewer features but still retaining its most critical information. The higher the reduction percentage, the more complex the reduction.
